### 🔬 Research Focus
I am a Master's student bridging the gap between **Mathematical Theory** and **High-Performance Systems**. My work focuses on the intersection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) theory and AI Safety.

- **Theoretical ML:** Measure-theoretic foundations of Reinforcement Learning, Stochastic Approximation, and Machine Unlearning.
- **AI Safety & Alignment:** Developing formal guarantees for policy unlearning and investigating adversarial reconstruction in state-action spaces.
- **On-Device AI (HPC):** High-performance deployment of ML kernels using **Vulkan, C++, and the Android NDK**.

### 🚀 Key Projects & Contributions

#### 🔹 [PyTorch / ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/16354) (Open Source)
**Vulkan Backend & Build Systems** Resolved critical Ninja build failures for the Vulkan backend by re-architecting `ShaderLibrary.cmake`. Implemented explicit file resolution strategies to ensure cross-generator compatibility for GLSL-to-SPIR-V compilation.

#### 🔹 [RL Unlearning: A Measure-Theoretic Approach](https://github.com/Peddinti-Sriram-Bharadwaj/RL_Unlearning)
**Research Project | Reinforcement Learning Theory** Developed a theoretical framework using **Carathéodory’s Extension Theorem** to model policy reconstruction vulnerabilities. Utilizing Martingale theory and Doob’s Optional Stopping Theorem to provide mathematical guarantees for unlearning completeness.

#### 🔹 [GPGPU Tree Reduction Engine](https://github.com/Peddinti-Sriram-Bharadwaj/GpuComputeTest)
**Systems Programming | Vulkan & Android NDK** Engineered a hybrid C++/Kotlin engine offloading heavy arithmetic to mobile GPUs. Optimized memory throughput using workgroup shared memory and explicit pipeline barriers.

### 📖 Literature & Influences
My research philosophy is shaped by a commitment to deep work and substrate-independent intelligence:
* **Life 3.0 (Max Tegmark):** Exploring the potential for intelligence to transcend biological substrates.
* **Deep Work (Cal Newport):** Cultivating cognitive focus as a primary research tool.
* **AlphaZero (Sadler & Regan):** Studying the emergence of alien, non-human strategic biases in self-play RL.
